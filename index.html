        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The <em>Peter Pan of the Sporting Group</em>, the forever-young Flat-Coated Retriever is a gundog of relatively recent origin. Happy, self-assured, and willing to please, a good Flat-Coat will retrieve a duck or a show ribbon with equal aplomb.
  The Flat-Coated Retriever's eponymous flat-lying coat comes in lustrous black or liver, with feathering at the legs and tail. A distinctive breed hallmark is the long head'unique among retrievers'which projects a smart and kindly expression. A Flat-Coat will stand as tall as a <b>Labrador Retriever</b>, but in silhouette they present a leaner, more elegant look. Dogdom's champion tail-waggers, Flat-Coats are among the happiest of all breeds. They mature slowly; some owners say that they never grow up at all, retaining a puppyish taste for rambunctious mischief into old age. This can be either delightful or exasperating, depending on your tolerance for such monkeyshines. This highly energetic breed requires lots of outdoorsy exercise.</p>

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>The Flat-Coat should be fed a high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog's age (<em>puppy, adult, or senior</em>) and activity level. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet or the dog's breeder if you have any questions or concerns about your dog's weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should <b>always</b> be available.</p>

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>The Flat-Coat is an <b>active sporting breed</b> and requires ample exercise every day for his physical and mental well-being.
